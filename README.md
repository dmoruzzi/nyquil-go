# NyQuil-go
This is a tiny application for automatically capturing and reporting the instruction computer laboratories' ink and paper status. This application is designed for the College of Engineering at Michigan State University. However, this application can be easily adapted to any environment running compatible printers.

## Usage

Night operation:
`$ ./nyquil-go` or `$ ./nyquil-go -mode n`

Day operation:
`$ ./nyquil-go -mode d`

## Compatibility
- HP LaserJet M806
- HP Color LaserJet M855

Other printers are likely supported. However, these remain untested.
